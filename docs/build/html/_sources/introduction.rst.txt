Version
---------------------------------------------------
This is version 1.0.0 of the SGCI Resource Description Specification schema. This work is released under an Apache 2.0
`license <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SGCI/sgci-resource-inventory/master/LICENSE>`_ .

---------------------------------------------------
Introduction
---------------------------------------------------

The user-facing components of the Cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem, science gateways and scientific workflow systems,
share a common need of interfacing with physical resources (storage systems and execution environments) to manage data and execute codes (applications).

However, there is no uniform, platform-independent way to describe either the resources or the applications. To address this, we propose uniform semantics for describing resources and applications that will be relevant to a diverse set of stakeholders.

The SGCI Resource Description Specification provides a standard way for institutions and service providers to describe storage and computing infrastructure broadly available to the research computing and science gateway community. SGCI Resource descriptions provide a foundation for interoperability across gateway components and other cyberinfrastructure software.

The current, initial version of the resource description language focuses on “traditional” HPC and high-throughput storage and computing resources

---------------------------------------------------
Definitions
---------------------------------------------------
Definitions of terms used in the specification will be added here.

---------------------------------------------------
Specification Format
---------------------------------------------------
SGCI resource descriptions are JSON documents that conform to the JSONSchema definition describing a particular version of the SGCI Resource Description Specification.

---------------------------------------------------
Examples
---------------------------------------------------
We illustrate the main features of the specification by walking through a few prototypical examples.

**SCIGAP Development Storage**

A server or virtual machine providing storage accessible over SSH can be registered as resource with a single object
provided within the ``"storageResources"`` attribute describing the connection information and the file systems present.
In the SGCI Resource Descriptions specification, it is assumed that all resources provide some kind of storage
capability; that is, at least one object within the ``storageResources`` array attribute must be provided,  and within
that object, at least one ``connections`` object must be provided.

A fundamental principle in the SGCI Resource Description Specification is that the ``host`` attribute uniquely
identifies a resource, and only one description document for a given ``host`` can exist in the inventory. The value of
``host`` is a network addressable identifier for the resource, most typically, a fully qualified domain name.

The following example describes a hypothetical storage resource used by the SCIGAP framework in its development environment.

.. literalinclude :: ../../data/scigap-dev.iu.storage.json
   :language: javascript

**Corral Storage System at TACC**

The Corral storage system at TACC provides a more complicated example, with multiple file systems mounted onto
a single resource and multiple types of storage endpoints available.
The following example illustrates how a system like Corral, with many storage functionalities, can be described in a
single document using the specification.

.. literalinclude :: ../../data/corral.tacc.storage.json
   :language: javascript


**Carbonate HPC**

Compute capabilities provided by resources are described within one or more  ``computeResources`` definitions. Unlike the
``storageResources`` attribute that must contain at least one object, the ``computeResources`` attribute is entirely
optional. Each compute resource object must define at least one ``connections`` object, analogous to the ``storageResource``
definitions. Additionally, each compute resource defines the way workloads are scheduled on the resource using the
``schedulerType`` property, with values such as ``FORK`` or ``BATCH``. The value of ``schedulerType`` dictates additional
objects that may be provided, such as the ``batchSystem`` object for value ``BATCH``.

Carbonate is Indiana University's large-memory computer cluster. The simple description below only includes the ``BATCH``
submission capability and does not provide any partion (queue) information.

.. literalinclude :: ../../data/carbonateHPC.iu.compute.json
   :language: javascript


**TACC Stampede2 Cluster**

In the final example describing the TACC Stampede2 supercomputer, two ``computeResources`` definitions are included,
one with ``schedulerType`` having value ``BATCH`` and one with ``schedulerType`` having value ``FORK``.
While all "real" workloads are required to be submitted to the
batch scheduler, the ``FORK`` scheduler could be utilized for "code compilation" tasks that run
directly on the login node. Additionally, the ``BATCH`` compute resource includes descriptions of the partitions
(queues). These are optional but very valuable for science gateway projects.

.. literalinclude :: ../../data/stampede2.tacc.xsede.json
  :language: javascript

---------------------------------------------------
Information Not In The Spec
---------------------------------------------------
Over the course of working on the specification, the project has decided to not include different resource
types and/or additional attributes of existing resource types in version 1.0 for various reasons. In some cases, we
plan to include the information in a subsequent version of the specification. In this section we collect some of the
information not chosen for v 1.0, together with the rationale for not including it.

  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements of a resource -- MFA requirements are definitely important to capture
    and will be included in a subsequent version of the spec, but we want to make sure we have a good, general-purpose
    way of describing what seem to be a rapidly evolving aspect of cyberinfrastructure.
  * Available Software Modules and other software on an execution system -- The project may include such information in
    a subsequent version of the spec, but we want to make sure we have good mechanisms in place for working with
    information that is changing rapidly.
  * More recent cloud storage and computing resource types -- A number of different cloud resource types, including container
    orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, as well as Functions-as-a-service such as AWS Lambda,
    were intentionally not included in version 1.0. We hope to include these in a future release once the community
    has built some expertise incorporating them into science gateways.
  * Databases and Web Services -- Databases, including MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, etc., and web service APIs like
    Figshare, Google Drive, etc., are not included in the spec, as these represent a significant departure from the
    kinds of resources defined in the current version. We do not currently plan to include them in any future version.

The SCGI Inventory is currently been integrated with Airavata, HUBzero |reg|  , and Tapis. We expect the inventory to be adapted by others soon.
